"This book is a survival manual for civilization. I want everyone--yes, every person on the planet--to learn its message and to face the challenge it poses: "What am I doing to help bring about a global Green New Deal in the early years of this decade?" For Americans, the first steps are clear: consign all climate deniers to permanent political oblivion and force all other policymakers to match fine words with deeds i.e. commit to the Pollin-Chomsky global program for climate stabilization, a massive expansion of good jobs, and just transition."  
\-- Daniel Ellsberg, author of The Doomsday Machine
