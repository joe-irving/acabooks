"Natasha King's No Borders takes European no‐borders activism as a cohesive theoretical and activist program, and sets about synthesizing its elements. For King, no‐borders activism fundamentally concerns the practices of making movement (more) free for individuals and working “against” borders. An analytically apropos account therefore privileges migrants rather than borders or migration flows, and King's does so by employing anarchism as both theoretical tradition and a normative position. Here, the critical idiom derives from an anarchist lexicon of coercive power and its refusal. Activist research and praxical inquiry are the methods germane to the project. Politics concern not the development of policy rules, nor the state's responsibility to noncitizens, but instead one's ethical responsibility to others — including migrants who move, hide, and survive among citizens."
