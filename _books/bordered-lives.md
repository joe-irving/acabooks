"Award-winning journalist Hsiao-Hung Pai specialises in communicating poignant human stories that many people find it convenient to keep out of sight and out of mind. She travels to meet migrants and asylum-seekers who have just been washed up on the shores of Lampedusa or Sicily and have been absorbed into dismal reception camps. While journalists ordinarily pitch up in such places and file their colour pieces before moving on to the next hot topic, Hsiao-Hung follows through, staying in touch with some of those she encounters - many of them children - throughout their journeys: into mainland Italy, to Germany where they face harassment from far-right groups, and to the appalling conditions in the camps on the coast of northwest France.  
  
These personal stories of individuals break apart the false distinction between "refugees" and "migrants", between "those seeking refuge" and "those wanting a better life", a distinction that has resulted in denying many people of their human rights."
