"In his latest contribution, Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism (2014), Harvey has written a wide-ranging and ambitious overview of contemporary capitalism and attempted to locate the sources of a more humane future. As the title suggests, Harvey examines capitalism through the prism of seventeen contradictions. There is nothing sacrosanct about the number seventeen but there is about the idea of contradiction. Harvey follows Marxâ€™s approach of seeking to understand any given social form by means of its inner conflicts and tensions and of seeking to understand social change in terms of the resolution of these conflicts and tensions. Any resolution, in turn, sets up new conflicts and tensions which drive future social change."
