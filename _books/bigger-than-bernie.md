title: Bigger Than Bernie
excerpt: "“Bigger Than Bernie offers an important contribution to the urgent debates
  about rebuilding the American Left. Leading members of the Democratic Socialists
  of America, Meagan Day and Micah Uetricht link that process to the improbable emergence
  of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign and his insistence on ‘Not me, Us.’ Day
  and Uetricht put flesh on Sanders’s call for a ‘political revolution’ which they
  see as not only critical to the success of Sanders’ campaign, but the revitalization
  of class struggle politics and organizing in the US. Buy, read, discuss and debate
  this book!”  – Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of From #BlackLivesMatter to Black
  Liberation"
